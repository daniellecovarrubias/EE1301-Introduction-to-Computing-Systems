# Synchronized-Christmas-Lights

This is a folder filled of all the code needed for the Syncronized Christmas Lights Project. 
This project was done for EE1301 Intro to Computing Systems.
Below is the project proposal:

A light sensor is used to know when it gets dark outside, which will allow the LEDs and Serial LCD screen to turn on.
The LCD screen will flash red and green and say "Merry Christmas".
Using IFTTT, it will send a notification letting the owner know that the lights have turned on.
Plug an audio device into the LEDs via AUX cord and play any song. The LEDs will sync to the beat of the song.
When no song is playing, the LEDs will default to flashing red and green.

This was built in Particle using a Photon. Many outside libraries were used. This is all coded in C++.
